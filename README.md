Duties included fixing a bug while trying to go back on the delete sponsor page.
This was simple and only required some minor fixes in the code of the buttons in order to work.
I also worked on editing the Details page of the DisplayLinks. I reformatted the text and added buttons to the Back and Edit links.
Code is temporarily unavailable.
